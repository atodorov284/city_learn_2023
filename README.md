The CityLearn 2023 Challenge is an international competition focused on designing and optimizing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms to manage energy systems in urban environments. Participants develop solutions that aim to minimize energy consumption, enhance grid stability, and optimize renewable energy usage. This repository contains our solution, submitted as part of the challenge.

## Project Overview

Urban energy systems face challenges related to efficiency, sustainability, and scalability. The CityLearn Challenge provides a simulation environment for researchers and practitioners to test their algorithms in a realistic urban setting. The environment models interactions between multiple buildings, energy storage systems, and the power grid.

Our solution incorporates state-of-the-art MARL techniques, leveraging recent advancements in reinforcement learning to address these challenges effectively.

## How to Run

### Training the Agents

To train the MARL agents, use the following command:

```bash
python main.py --mode train
```

Optional arguments:
- `--episodes`: Number of training episodes (default: 1000)
- `--config`: Path to the configuration file (default: `configs/default.json`)

### Evaluating the Agents

To evaluate the performance of trained agents:

```bash
python main.py --mode evaluate
```

### Visualization

To visualize agent performance and energy usage patterns:

```bash
python visualize.py
```
